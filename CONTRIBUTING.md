## Style

The style of the repo follows that of the Linux kernel, in particular:

* Pull requests should be rebased to small atomic commits so that the merged history is more coherent
* The subject of the commit should be in the form "`<subsystem>: <subject>`"
* More details in the body
* Match surrounding coding style (line wrapping, spaces, etc)

More details in the [SubmittingPatches](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html) document included with the Linux kernel.  In particular the following sections:

* `2) Describe your changes`
* `3) Separate your changes`
